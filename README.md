This tool is a **PoC** for showcasing how technology can be used to fight COVID-19 spread by identifying and tracking movement of people post lock-down without compromising their **privacy & safety**. This should allow lifting of lock-down restrictions for at least people who are at lowest risk, perfectly healthy, & declared **COVID-19 Negative** by ICMR authorized test labs. **ePasses** can be issued to such people especially essential-services/health/supply-chain workers first so that they can resume critical services.

## FAQ ##

**Who can use this app?**
- Anybody with a smart phone & internet connectivity can access this app
- No need to download or install the app on your smart phone
- No need to turn Bluetooth or location services ON continuously

**What do I need to do?**
- Open the app in the browser of your smart phone
- Click on Generate ePass (Blue) button
- Take an online self-screening/assessment test to identify your level of risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection
- Based on your answers the app will issue a colored QR Code. Color indicates your risk-level
    - Green for Low Risk
    - Blue for Medium Risk
    - Orange for High Risk
    - Red for Emergency
- The app also suggests further steps based on your answers, for e.g. it suggests if it is mandatory for you to get a lab test done for COVID-19 infection
    - It helps you find nearest ICMR approved test centers
    - It helps you view your travel history since January of this year if you have a Google account
- If you wish to seek immediate help then you can provide your contact details & follow on-screen instruction to seamlessly forward your assessment answers & contact information to Government's WhatsApp helpline or Email address with one click
- You can also avail free online consultation provided by 3rd party online aggregators / service providers

**What's the purpose of the QR Code?**
- You can use this QR code as an ePass to get exception from lock-down restrictions
- Only Green colored QR Codes are allowed entry at public places
- QR code is valid for only 7 days from the day it was generated
- Security or administration personnel of public places like malls, IT parks, factories, farmers markets, etc will ask for the QR Code
- They will scan & verify if the QR code really belongs to you
- Each scan creates a record of your visit
- This information can be pushed to government's database for later tracking your movement
- In the worst-case-scenario if you are later found COVID-19 positive then it is possible for the government to identify which places you visited in the past 7 days which helps in finding people who may have been contracted

**What's in the QR Code?**
- QR Code is tightly associated with the device (PC or Smart Phone) that generated it
- It serves as a digital surrogate identity that allows concealing users actual sensitive information 
- If you lose the device then all QR Codes associated to it will become invalid. You will have to generate new code on another device

**But what if I lie in the self-assessment?**
- Green QR code can only be generated by those who are at low risk & have undergone ICMR Approved COVID-19 lab tests (Rapid Antibodies Test, Polymerase Chain Reaction, etc.) at authorized private or government labs only
- These labs will issue a unique number for each test they conduct which gets stored in government's database against patient's identity information such as Pan Card, Aadhaar Card, Driving License, Passport, etc.
- Enter that unique number while taking the self-screening/assessment & that will generate Green QR code

**Can somebody steal my QR Code & use it?**
- QR Code is just a unique identifier for the device that generated it
- If QR code is intentionally shared with others, stolen by others, or fabricated by over-smart user then during verification that will be caught
- If your device is damage or stolen then you will have to regenerate QR Code from a new device
- All previously registered devices will be blacklisted

[**Note:** All integrations with government's systems are currently not implemented as this is just a prototype of the proposed solution]

![Workflow](https://github.com/kaizenberg/Sarvekshan/blob/master/assets/img/workflow.gif)

This tool does not store or distribute any user private information as there is no backend for this application. Also, it doesn't collect any user information without the user's consent. It is built using only opensource technologies. Together this whole idea can be enhanced & improved to fit many other peer-to-peer authorization scenarios.

These dependencies may be replaced after Node.js refactoring.

TODO
- Node.js package management
- Code Refactoring for latest ECMA Script
- Use WebPack for assets optimization (minify, combine, uglify, watch, cache bursting)
- reCaptcha/'I am not a robot' test (Optional)
- Link to user privacy statement if needed (Optional)
- Government UID Authentication (Currently not supported for non-native apps / JavaScript clients)
- Convert to SPA (Maybe Angular)
